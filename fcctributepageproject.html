            Here is a brief overview of who Harry Potter is
        </h2>
        <li> When harry was young, his parents were killed by a very powerful wizard named Voldemort. He used a killing curse on them and intended to Kill Harry as well,
            But his spell backfired and actually turned Harry into a holcrux (an object in which one deposits part of their soul deeming them invincible until said object
             is destroyed). Harry was raised for most of his life by his mogel(non magic) aunt and uncle, who treated him extremely poorly. Until one day when he was about
            13-14 he started to notice he could do strange things that no one else could. This is when Hogwarts school of wizardry made contact with him and saved him from
            his mogel family. At Hogwarts he learned how to harness his magic and become more powerful anbd eventually found out about his past. He then studied the mystical
            arts for years until he became powerful enough to fight voldmort himself. He fought him many times but only when he learned what truly happened to his parents 
            did he realise that he had to die in order to kill voldemort completely. Over the years of school, Harry protected and saved many people from voldemorts cruel 
            hand and eventually killed him indefinately. Harry potter is the most powerful wizard to ever have lived.
